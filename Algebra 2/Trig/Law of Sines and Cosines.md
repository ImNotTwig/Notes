Law of Sines 

$\displaystyle \frac{\sin A}{a} =\frac{\sin B}{b} =\frac{\sin C}{c}$

Sometimes $a$, $b$, and $c$ are replaced with $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, respectively, just as $x$ is replaced with $\theta$.

Law of Cosines

$c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos(C)$,
$a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\cos (A)$,
$b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\cos(B)$.

The law of cosines is useful for solving a triangle when all three sides or two sides and their included angle are given.
