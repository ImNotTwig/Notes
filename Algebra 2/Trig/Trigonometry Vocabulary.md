Right Triangle:
	A triangle which has an angle of $90\degree$.

The three basic trigonometric ratios are called sine, cosine and tangent.
Definitions of these functions, as well as their reciprocal functions are in [[Trigonometric Ratios]].

Periodic Function:
	A function which repeats forever.
- Max:
	The highest $y$ value that the function reaches.
- Minimum:
	The lowest $y$ value that the function reaches.
- Period:
	The distance between the "peaks" of a function.
- Amplitude:
	The average of the absolute value of the max and minimum of the function.
- Phase Shift:
	The distance that the function was shifted horizontally from the parent function.
	eg: $\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)$
- Vertical Shift:
	The distance that the function was shifted vertically from the parent function.

Unit Circle:
	A circle with a radius of $1$ with its center at $(0,0)$.

Degree:
	A measurement of an angle, denoted by the $\degree$ symbol, in which a full rotation takes $360\degree$.

Radian:
	A measurement of an angle, in which a full rotation takes $2\pi$ rad. 
	Often you do not specify if a measurement is in radians, because radians are a standard unit and degrees are not.

You can convert between radians and degrees, the formulas are in [[Converting Between Radians and Degrees]].
