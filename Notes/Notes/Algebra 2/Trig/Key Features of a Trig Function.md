What are the key features of the graph of the function
	$\displaystyle y\ =\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.29,0.56,0.89}{4}\cos(\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{3} x) +\textcolor[rgb]{0.49,0.83,0.13}{1}$

The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of cosine.

$\textcolor[rgb]{0.29,0.56,0.89}{Amplitude } \textcolor[rgb]{0.29,0.56,0.89}{\displaystyle =\ |4|\ =\ 4}$

To calculate the period, divide $\displaystyle 2\pi$ by the coefficient of $\displaystyle x$

$\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{Period = }\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{\displaystyle \frac{2\pi }{3}}$

The graph of $\displaystyle y=4\cos(3x)+1$ has been shifted up $\displaystyle 1$ unit.

$\textcolor[rgb]{0.49,0.83,0.13}{Vertical\ Shift }\textcolor[rgb]{0.49,0.83,0.13}{\displaystyle =\ 1}$

There is no phase shift. The graph has not been shifted horizontally from that of $\displaystyle y\ =\ \cos x$. In terms of the general form, $\displaystyle y\ =\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.29,0.56,0.89}{a}\cos[\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{b}( x-c)] \ +\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.49,0.83,0.13}{d} ,\ c=0$.
