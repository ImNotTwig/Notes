Initial side ( Standard Position ) is the side of the intial angle on the $x$ axis

Terminal Side is the side of the angle that is opposite to the Standard Position

Positive rotations are counter-clockwise like $\displaystyle 180\degree$

Negative rotations are clockwise like $\displaystyle -180\degree$ (notice the negative sign)

A reference angle is in standard position, the reference angle is the acute angle formed between the terminal side of the angle and the $\displaystyle x$ axis

The unit circle is a circle that has its center at the origin $(0,0)$ and has a radius of $1$.

In any right triangle formed with the radius as the hypotenuse, the length of the hypotenuse is $1$.

Based on right triangle trigonometry

$\displaystyle \sin \theta \ =$  The $y$ coordinate

$\displaystyle \cos \theta \ =$ The $x$ coordinate
